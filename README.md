# python-api-challenge

Apologies for a late submission, I was able to write the proper code but I could not get the geoapify key to work like it had earlier, I thought getting a new key would fix the problem but it still would not search for the hotels I wanted. Other than that the assignment went over quite well.

There are some interesting findings when looking at the scatter plots created, not all of them have close correlations however some do.
